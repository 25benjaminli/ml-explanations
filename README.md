This repository contains an expository [paper](paper/manuscript.pdf) on some common ML/DL approaches (**best advised to download it so that links are clickable**). I have been writing it to improve my fundamentals, but I hope that it can also be a helpful pedagogical tool for motivated and excited ML learners. I am also a very visual learner, so I like making diagrams with [draw.io](https://draw.io). Finally, there are also some code samples (and I hope to release more with time). 

Please note any suggestions in the issues section of the github repository - I am constantly updating the paper with better descriptions for existing sections, more architectures, and fixing issues/typos.
