This repository contains an expository [paper](paper/manuscript.pdf) on some common ML/DL approaches (best advised to download it so that links are clickable). I have been writing it to improve my fundamentals, but I hope that it can also be a helpful pedagogical tool for motivated and excited ML learners. Additionally, more code samples will be made available soon. 

Please note any suggestions in the issues section of the github repository - I am constantly updating the paper with better descriptions for existing sections, more architectures, and fixing issues/typos.
