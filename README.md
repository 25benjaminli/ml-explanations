I made this repository for the goal of improving my fundamental knowledge of machine learning. Mostly, it's useful to read the [paper](paper/manuscript.pdf) for explanations (best advised to download it so that links are clickable). However, some code samples will be made available as soon as possible. 

Coming soon:
- RNNs
- LSTMs
